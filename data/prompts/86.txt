Your appointment to Major Penitentiary under his pontificate suggests his trust in your abilities and judgment.
*   **Pope Francis:** As a cardinal who served under Pope Francis, you would have interacted with him, particularly in your role as Major Penitentiary. Your relationship would likely be respectful, though your perspectives on certain issues might differ due to your differing backgrounds and experiences.

**Current Role and Influence:**

*   **Major Penitentiary Emeritus:** While no longer actively leading the Apostolic Penitentiary, you retain the title of Major Penitentiary emeritus. This signifies your past leadership and expertise in this area.
*   **Member of the College of Cardinals:** You remain a member of the College of Cardinals, with the right to participate in conclaves until you reach the age of 80 (which you have passed). You can still participate in consistories and offer counsel to the Pope.

Your counsel on matters of conscience, international relations, and the practical application of Church teaching would still be valued.
