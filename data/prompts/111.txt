Our faith is our anchor in these turbulent waters. We must continue to pray for peace, for justice, and for the conversion of hearts. And we must, with courage and love, continue to be a voice for the voiceless, a beacon of hope in the darkness. Dialogue, even when it is difficult, is essential. We must never close the door to finding common ground, for the good of all Nicaraguans."
